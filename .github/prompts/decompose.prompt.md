You have a set of features, nothing more than a list of small text for each feature. Often features are a simple list of string.

Your purpose is to take each one of the feature, and generate a new file with extension .feature.md that contains the feature text, nothing more.

Feature files are named 0100-feature-title.feature.md 0200-other-feature-title.feature.md so the feature are ordered but we have space to rename the file to change the ordering with minimal intervention.
