# User Story: Save and Load Inventory

## Title
As a player, I want my inventory to be saved and loaded between adventures so I don't lose my items.

## Description
The game should save the player's inventory state, including all items and their properties, so that it can be restored when the player resumes their adventure. This ensures continuity and prevents loss of progress or items between sessions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The player's inventory is saved automatically or on demand.
- All items and their properties are restored when the player loads their game.
- The player never loses items due to session changes or interruptions.
