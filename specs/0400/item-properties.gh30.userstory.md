# User Story: Item Properties

## Title
As a player, I want items to optionally have properties (e.g., durability, effect, value) so they can have different uses or significance.

## Description
Items in the game may have additional properties such as durability, effects, or value, which influence their usefulness or role in gameplay. These properties should be clearly displayed to the player and affect how items can be used, traded, or managed.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Items can have optional properties like durability, effect, or value.
- The properties are displayed to the player when examining the item.
- The properties influence gameplay, such as item usage, trading, or strategy.
