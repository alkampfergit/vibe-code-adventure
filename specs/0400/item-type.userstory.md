# User Story: Item Type Classification

## Title
As a player, I want items to have a type (e.g., tool, consumable, quest item) so I know how they can be used.

## Description
Each item should be classified by type, such as tool, consumable, or quest item. The type helps players understand the intended use or function of the item and informs decisions about how to interact with or manage items in their inventory.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Every item is assigned a type (e.g., tool, consumable, quest item).
- The item type is displayed to the player when examining the item.
- The item type influences how the item can be used or interacted with in the game.
