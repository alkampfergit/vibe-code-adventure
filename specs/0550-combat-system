I need to have a combat system in place for the character so that they can engage in battles with enemies. The character can fight with NPC and monsters.

The combact system is in turn and can engage a fighting with only one npc or monster in a single time.

We need to have weapons, where each weapon does a specific range of damage and potential bonuses. Characteristics (like strenght) of the character and monster should affect the fighting.
