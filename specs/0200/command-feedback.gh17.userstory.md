# User Story: Command Feedback for Unrecognized Input

## Title
As a player, I want to receive feedback if my command is not understood so that I know how to correct it.

## Description
When a player enters a command that the game does not recognize or cannot process, the system should provide immediate and clear feedback. The feedback should help the player understand what went wrong and, if possible, suggest how to correct the command. This ensures a smoother gameplay experience and reduces player frustration.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The system detects when a command is not understood or is invalid.
- The player receives a clear message indicating the command was not recognized.
- The feedback includes suggestions or examples to help the player correct their input.
