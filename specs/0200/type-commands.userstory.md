# User Story: Type Commands to Interact

## Title
As a player, I want to type commands like "go north" or "take key" so that I can interact with the game world.

## Description
Players should be able to interact with the game world by typing natural language commands that follow a verb-noun structure (e.g., "go north", "take key"). The parser should interpret these commands and execute the corresponding actions in the game. The system should provide feedback for both valid and invalid commands.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The player can type commands in a verb-noun format to perform actions in the game.
- The parser correctly interprets and executes valid commands.
- The system provides clear feedback for both successful and unsuccessful commands.
