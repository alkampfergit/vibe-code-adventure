# User Story: Publish or Unpublish Adventure

## Title
As an author, I want to publish or unpublish an adventure so that I control when it is available to players.

Authors should be able to control the visibility of their adventures by publishing or unpublishing them. Publishing makes the adventure available to players, while unpublishing hides it from the player list. This allows authors to manage when adventures are accessible for play.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The author can publish or unpublish any adventure they have created.
- Published adventures are visible and accessible to players.
- Unpublished adventures are hidden from players but remain available for editing by the author.
