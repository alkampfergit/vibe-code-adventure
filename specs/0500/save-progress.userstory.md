# User Story: Save Progress While Editing Adventure

## Title
As an author, I want to save my progress while editing an adventure so that I donâ€™t lose my work.

## Description
Authors should be able to save their work at any point while editing an adventure. This ensures that changes are not lost due to interruptions or errors, and allows authors to resume editing from where they left off.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The author can save progress at any time during adventure editing.
- All changes are reliably saved and can be restored later.
- The system provides feedback confirming that progress has been saved.
