# User Story: Adventure Goals

## Title
As a player, I want each adventure to have one or more goals that guide my experience, but I can exit the adventure even if I do not accomplish all goals.

## Description
Each adventure should define clear goals or objectives that provide direction and motivation for the player. These goals help structure the gameplay and give players a sense of purpose. However, players should have the freedom to exit the adventure at any time, regardless of whether all goals have been completed.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Each adventure defines one or more clear goals for the player.
- The goals are communicated to the player at the start and can be reviewed during gameplay.
- The player can exit the adventure at any time, even if not all goals are accomplished.
