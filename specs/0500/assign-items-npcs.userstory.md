# User Story: Assign Items and NPCs to Rooms

## Title
As an author, I want to assign items and NPCs to specific rooms so that the world feels populated.

## Description
Adventure authors should be able to place items and non-player characters (NPCs) in specific rooms within the game world. This allows for a richer, more interactive environment and enables the creation of unique scenarios and challenges for players.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The author can assign items and NPCs to any room in the adventure.
- The assigned items and NPCs appear in the correct rooms during gameplay.
- The placement of items and NPCs enhances the sense of a populated, dynamic world.
