# User Story: Session Persistence

## Title
As a player, I want my session to persist so that I remain logged in until I choose to log out.

## Description
The game should remember the player's login session, so that the player remains logged in even after closing or refreshing the browser, until they explicitly log out. This ensures a seamless experience and prevents the need to re-enter the username on every visit. Session data should be securely stored and automatically restored when the player returns.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The player remains logged in after closing and reopening the browser, unless they have logged out.
- The session is automatically restored when the player returns to the game.
- The player is only required to log in again if they have explicitly logged out.
