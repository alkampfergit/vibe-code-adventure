# User Story: Enter Username to Log In

## Title
As a player, I want to enter a username to log in so that I can access the game without a password.

## Description
Players should be able to log in to the game by simply entering a unique username, without the need for a password or additional authentication steps. The system should check if the username is already in use and provide immediate feedback. If the username is available, the player is logged in and can proceed to the game. If the username is taken, the player is prompted to choose another one.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The login screen prompts the player to enter a username.
- The system checks if the entered username is already in use.
- If the username is available, the player is logged in and taken to the next step.
- If the username is already in use, the player receives a clear message and can try a different username.
