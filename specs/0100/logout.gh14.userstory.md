# User Story: Log Out

## Title
As a player, I want to be able to log out so that I can switch to a different username.

## Description
Players should have the ability to log out of their current session at any time. Logging out should return the player to the login screen, allowing them to enter a different username and start a new session. All unsaved progress should be clearly communicated to the player before logging out.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The player can access a log out option from the game interface.
- Logging out ends the current session and returns the player to the login screen.
- The player is informed if any unsaved progress will be lost before confirming log out.
