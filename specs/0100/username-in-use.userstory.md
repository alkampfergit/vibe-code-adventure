# User Story: Username Already in Use Notification

## Title
As a player, I want to be notified if my chosen username is already in use so that I can pick a different one.

## Description
When a player attempts to log in with a username that is already taken by another active session, the system should immediately notify the player and prompt them to choose a different username. The notification should be clear and user-friendly, ensuring the player understands why they cannot use the chosen username.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The system checks for username availability when the player attempts to log in.
- If the username is already in use, the player receives a clear notification explaining the issue.
- The player is prompted to enter a different username and can retry without reloading the page.
