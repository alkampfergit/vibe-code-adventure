Inventory management system to keep tracks of character belonging

- As a player, I want to view my character's inventory so I can see what items I have.
- As a player, I want my inventory to be saved and loaded between adventures so I don't lose my items.
- As a player, I want to add items to my inventory when I find or receive them.
- As a player, I want to remove items from my inventory when I use or drop them.
- As a player, I want items to have a name and description so I can understand what each item is.
- As a player, I want items to have a type (e.g., tool, consumable, quest item) so I know how they can be used.
- As a player, I want items to optionally have properties (e.g., durability, effect, value) so they can have different uses or significance.
- As a player, I want to examine an item in my inventory to see its details.
