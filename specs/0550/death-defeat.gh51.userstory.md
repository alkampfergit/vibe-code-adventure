## Title
As a player, I want the combat system to handle death or defeat (for both my character and enemies), so the consequences of battle are clear.

## Description

## Acceptance Criteria

- Consequences of defeat (e.g., game over, respawn, loot drop) are clearly communicated.
- The player receives feedback and options after a defeat or victory.
