# User Story: Characteristics Influence Combat Outcome

## Title
As a player, I want my character’s and the enemy’s characteristics (such as strength) to influence the outcome of combat, so that stats matter in battles.

## Description
Combat outcomes should be determined by the relevant characteristics of both the player’s character and their enemies (e.g., strength, agility, intelligence). These stats should directly affect damage, accuracy, defense, and other combat factors, making character development meaningful.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Combat calculations use both player and enemy characteristics to determine outcomes.
- The influence of each characteristic is clear and consistent.
- Players can see how their stats affect combat results, either through feedback or documentation.
