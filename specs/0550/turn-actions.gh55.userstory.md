# User Story: Turn-Based Combat Actions

## Title
As a player, I want to choose between different actions during my turn (e.g., attack, use item, flee), so I have strategic options in combat.

## Description
During each turn in combat, players should be able to select from a variety of actions, such as attacking, using an item, or attempting to flee. This system provides strategic depth and allows players to adapt their tactics based on the situation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The player can choose from multiple actions (attack, use item, flee, etc.) during their turn in combat.
- Each action has a clear effect and is executed immediately.
- The system provides feedback on the outcome of the chosen action.
