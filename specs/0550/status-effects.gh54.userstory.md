# User Story: Status Effects in Combat

## Title
As a player, I want status effects (such as poison, stun, or buffs) to influence combat, so battles are more dynamic and challenging.

## Description
Combat should include status effects like poison, stun, debuffs, and buffs that can alter the outcome of battles. These effects add depth and strategy, requiring players to adapt their tactics based on current conditions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Status effects (e.g., poison, stun, buffs) can be applied to both player and enemies during combat.
- The effects influence combat outcomes and player decisions.
- The player is notified when a status effect is applied, removed, or expires.
