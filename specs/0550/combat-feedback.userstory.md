# User Story: Combat Action Feedback

## Title
As a player, I want to receive feedback on the outcome of each action (e.g., hit, miss, critical hit, blocked), so I understand what happens during combat.

## Description
During combat, the game should provide immediate and clear feedback for every action taken, such as attacks, misses, critical hits, and blocks. This feedback helps players understand the flow of battle and the consequences of their choices.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The player receives feedback for every combat action (hit, miss, critical, block, etc.).
- Feedback is clear, timely, and easy to understand.
- The feedback helps players make informed decisions in future combat rounds.
