# User Story: Turn-Based Combat System

## Title
As a player, I want my character to engage in turn-based combat with a single NPC or monster at a time, so that battles are structured and manageable.

## Description
Combat should be structured as a turn-based system, where the player and a single opponent (NPC or monster) take turns performing actions. This approach makes battles more manageable and allows for thoughtful decision-making.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Combat is conducted in a turn-based manner, with the player and one opponent acting in sequence.
- The player is clearly informed when it is their turn and when it is the opponentâ€™s turn.
- The system manages turn order and ensures fair play for both sides.
