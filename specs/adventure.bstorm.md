I need a web application that simulates the old good textual adventure that we have in the 80/90s.

## Features

- Simple authentication process where the user simply specify a username and no password
- Text-based command parser (e.g., "go north", "take key")
- Main character (protagonist) creation with basic attributes.
- Inventory management system to keep tracks of character belonging
- Concept of adventure, where the character can explore, interact, and solve puzzles
- Save and load game progress
- Multiple rooms/locations with descriptions
- Basic non-player character (NPC) interactions
- Simple scoring or progress tracking
- Responsive web interface (desktop and mobile)
