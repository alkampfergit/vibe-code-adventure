Save and load game progress

- As a player, I want to save my current game progress so that I can continue later from where I left off.
- As a player, I want to load a previously saved game so that I can resume my adventure.
- As a player, I want to see a confirmation when my game is successfully saved or loaded.
- As a player, I want to manage multiple save slots so I can have different game sessions.
- As a player, I want my character's inventory, location, and progress to be restored accurately when loading a game.
- As a player, I want to be notified if there is an error during saving or loading.
