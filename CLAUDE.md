# Software description

A web app that recreates classic 80s/90s text adventures. Players log in with just a username, create a character, and explore a world using typed commands. The game features inventory management, multiple rooms, NPC interactions, puzzles, scoring, and the ability to save/load progress. The interface is responsive for both desktop and mobile.

# Technology Stack for Text Adventure Web Application

## Frontend

- **React**: For building a responsive and interactive user interface.
- **TypeScript**: Adds type safety and improves code maintainability.
- **Material UI**: For modern, responsive styling.

## Backend

- **Node.js** with **Express**: Handles REST API endpoints and core game logic.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures consistency and type safety across the backend.

## Persistence

- Use Node.js node:sqlite for a lightweight, file-based database to store data for the game.

## Tooling & Testing

- **Jest**: For unit and integration testing.

This stack is designed for rapid development, scalability, and maintainability, suitable for a modern web-based text adventure

# Development Workflow

- Commit after each user story implementation to maintain clear version history and traceability
- Write unit tests after implementing a feature to verify its functionality
- Prefer testing each feature instead of doing end-to-end tests

## USER STORY WRITING

When you implement a .userstory.md file, you should always generate unit tests and foster inversion of control creating components that are not have hard dependencies on other components. This will allow you to develop user stories in isolation.

All user stories are in specs subfolder in a directory with a number.


## ‚Å†Server Management

- don't run 'npm run dev', always try to use active running server first because the user usually keeps a server running
